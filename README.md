# CSpredictor
CSpredictor is a Python-based software interface to detemine Slag-Ash-Based Geopolymer concrete mix design for a given compressive strength. The prediction employs a well-trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. This interface additonally calculates global warming potential (GWP) of each design mix to ease the selection of more sustainable concrete mix. The UI and prediction process is indicated in the following figure,
